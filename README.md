# Netlogo-Ant-Mound-With_Pheromones
Using Netlogo, I simulated a simple Ant hill!

It has a 3 x 3 nest in the middle of the simulation environment where the ants start.

The ants go out and eat a piece of green patch, also known as food, it leaves a black spot on the eaten spot, and... leaves a unit of pheromone!

The pheromone evaporates from every 1 to 100 ticks per unit of pheromone, which is set by the user using a slider. 

The pheromone alters the behaviour of the ant that it will only seek the nearest next pheromone to it.

The number of ants can be altered between 1, none or 100 ants!

I can also set the maximum rotation size (which is the maximum amount the ant is able to rotate 0-359 degrees). 

as well as the maximum step size (0-45 as the grid is a 32 x
